Responders (_responders_ branch contains an example – adding remarks to gists):

* https://github.com/plataformatec/responders[gem responders]
* also includes a responders controller generator, so your scaffold
  can be customized to use respond_with instead of default respond_to blocks.
+
you need to explicitly opt-in to use this generator by adding the following
to your _config/application.rb_:
```ruby
config.app_generators.scaffold_controller :responders_controller
```
